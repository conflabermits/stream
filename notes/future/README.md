# Notes For Future Streams

This might not be terribly relevant to anyone else, but I needed a place to store links, references, and notes for future streams or stream ideas.

## Future Ideas For Future Streams

* JSON prettifier webpage (started [here](https://github.com/conflabermits/json-prettifier))
* Font-changer browser plugin
* Wordle Helper reboot
* Countdown solver
* Pokemon lister
* Database webservice
* Go + GraphQL backend service
* Twitch Chat Bot (started [here](https://github.com/conflabermits/stream-chatbot/))
    * Add "gang" features:
        * `!joingang` to align yourself with a "gang" (e.g., "tea gang" or "coffee gang").
        * `!changegang` to change between them, and `!leavegang` to leave them.
        * Writing username, user ID, and gang choice to a database.
        * `!listgangs` to list potential gangs and maybe members too.

## Twitch Chat Bot Notes/Resources

Not sure what to use it for yet, but an [alphabetizer](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/blob/main/shell/alphab/alphab.sh) might be one [idea](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-sort-a-slice-of-strings-in-golang/#).
